Intro

    This is a banking program that I am creating to help strengthen my programming abilities in Java.

    This is a simple ui in the terminal and easy to use where you only need to enter numbers to select your choices

    You can login and also create a bank account. Each account will start off with $1000 so that the user can get an idea of how 
    the program works.

Future
    I may add a whole new functionality where I would use this program for a part of a bigger program such as a "real world simulator"
